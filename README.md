## Installing

the installing process is slight complex

after installing 
1. the furnace plugin
2. the Funace mod

you need to add `furnace.env` to the `R2Northstar/plugins` folder

**profiles are not supported**

then the content would look smth like this
```bash
PATH_MOD="R2Northstar/mods/cat_or_not.Furnace/mod/maps/compile/"
PATH_COMPILER="MRVN-radiant/remap.exe"
```

1. `PATH_MOD` the path to the `compile` folder in `cat_or_not.Furnace` mod
2. `PATH_COMPILER` the path to `remap` compiler (yes you need to download [MRVN-radiant](https://github.com/MRVN-Radiant/MRVN-Radiant/actions))

## Using the mod
you get a cool window to edit the map, I think the ux is fine, so you'll be fine `;)`

both the plugin and mod must be working or else stuff will break

to actually edit the map load the map `mp_default` with the `map` command.
this is the map that furnace uses. you can add other maps to the `compile` folder with the `furace` format

if you have any issues you can contact me (`cat_or_not#3394`) in the [Northstar](https://discord.com/invite/9x2rqEbEaN) discord server. Please no dms!
